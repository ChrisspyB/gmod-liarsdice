Going to add some comments to explain how I think each function works, should help me get back into the swing of things.
Main goal for now is to clean up the code:
	Strings
	Better variable names
An issue that is becoming increasing apparent is my inconsistency when refererring the players:
	sometimes I refer to the player object
	sometimes their chair
	sometimes their index
I had reasons for this, but I should act to make it consistent.
For the sake of the game, maybe shouldn't record each players last bet (makes bluffing harder).
	Overruled: Will continue to display each player's last bet because it looks nice.
Might shift focus to updating UI, then ensuring players aren't sent superfluous information.

Summary:
+ Added comments here and there
+ Player's panel gets progressively redder when its their turn.

Working more on making simplifying the code:
	playerinfo[1][1] ---> playerinfo[1]['isAI']
	etc.
So...I've done this but in the process I've somehow made the server treat each player as an AI, how weird.
	Figured it out, I was doing this:
		data = {stuff}
		for i in some range:
			playerinfo[i] = data
	This meant playerinfo[any number] all stored the same data, not a copy of the data.
	Fix:
		for i in some range:
			playerinfo[i] = {stuff}
