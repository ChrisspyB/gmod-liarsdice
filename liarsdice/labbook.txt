Going to add some comments to explain how I think each function works, should help me get back into the swing of things.
Main goal for now is to clean up the code:
	Strings
	Better variable names
An issue that is becoming increasing apparent is my inconsistency when refererring the players:
	sometimes I refer to the player object
	sometimes their chair
	sometimes their index
I had reasons for this, but I should act to make it consistent.
For the sake of the game, maybe shouldn't record each players last bet (makes bluffing harder).
	Overruled: Will continue to display each player's last bet because it looks nice.
Might shift focus to updating UI, then ensuring players aren't sent superfluous information.

Summary:
+ Added comments here and there
+ Player's panel gets progressively redder when its their turn.
